# Photo-to-Sketch-Coversion-using-Federated-Learning

We (Lakshya Gupta and Anannya Popat) provide a novel method that employs machine learning (ML) to train the camera filter and provide generic filter capabilities while  taking privacy concerns into account using the concept of federated learning and auto-encoding with the help of the CUHK Face Sketch Database (CUFS) dataset to transform any given image into a sketched representation of itself.

Example Input Image (Photo Vs Corresponding Sketch):

Example Output Image using Auto-encoder and Federated Learning:

[Due to some issues with the current Tensorflow Federated on Google colab, there are some errors on running the import cell at the moment, although it was working a few months back]
